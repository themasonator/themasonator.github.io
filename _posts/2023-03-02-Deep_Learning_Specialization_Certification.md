# Deeplearning.ai Deep Learning Specialization
I am proud to announce that I have completed the Deeplearning.ai Deep Learning Specialization. I learned useful skills and theory in statistics, computer vision, NLP,  and sequence understanding.
I look forward to applying these skills, most usefully those relating to bias, variance and overfitting, to my future projects on this portfolio. <br>
